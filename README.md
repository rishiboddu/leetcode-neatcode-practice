Hi! My name is Rishitha Boddu and I'm an undergraduate student at UC Berkeley recruiting for various fields in tech/business (data analysis, SWE, quant, PM, etc) so I'll be uploading all my solutions, notes, and commentaries for leetcode practice problems to this repository. This is a personal repository for me to reflect on my progress in the future and continue to grow in terms of efficient programming and multi-language programming. This ReadMe serves as a main table of contents for easy navigation between my past solutions.
